/**
 * This module contains data-modification functions for working with diffs generated via
 * the python DeepDiff library. The idea is that we have fairly heavily nested state
 * python-side, and we will be transmitted diffs as that state changes, to allow us to
 * avoid having to receive the entire state from the StateManager every time the state changes.
 *
 * Further, since we are using React, react requires an entirely new object to be created
 * on state updates, which is a large amount of memory to burn to change a single key in
 * an object 6 layers of nesting down. To solve this, we rely on the `immer` library,
 * which knows how to create "new" objects without re-allocating unchanged memory. Since React state
 * objects don't change, this is both safe and considered good practice. Basically
 * the way it works is that immer creates a "draft" object, which is very similar to a
 * recording mock used for unit tests. Once you modify the draft object, immer
 * will create a new object that shares memory with the old object where possible.
 *
 * It's worth mentioning that we depend on using the **Delta** portion of python's DeepDiff library.
 * using the deltas makes it specify every changed scalar rather than grouping things into
 * objects that get added, which complicates things dramatically when trying to batch updates.
